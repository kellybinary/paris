          <p class="reverse_color text-justify">Out of all the countries in the world, why did we decide to set up base in Iran? It’s simple. According to the World Economic Forum, Iran ranks high on the list of the top countries with the most engineering graduates, making it a major repository
            of IT talent. However, the talent pool is relatively untapped due to the lack of foreign investment in the country.</p>
          <p class="reverse_color text-justify">We aim to tap into Iran’s large pool of IT talent who we believe to have world-class potential. Come and join us in developing state-of-the-art financial software solutions that make an impact around the world.</p>
